# TheRestaurants
Build a Simple Node.js App to Display Dynamic Content with Express and EJS

This project (app.js) stores a list of data consisting of the restaurant name and its image in an array object.
The data is sent to an EJS page (views/restaurants.ejs) when the server receives a "GET" request with the URL ending "/restaurants" relative to its root path.

The EJS page will loop through the array and display its content in an unordered list.
